        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. 
            My journey into software development began with a transition from mechanical engineering, driven by a passion 
            for technology and innovation. I am a graduate of the Java DevMountain/HackBright bootcamp (2022), where I 
            honed my skills in Java and further developed a keen interest in software architecture and development.

        <h2>Personal Insights</h2>
        <h3>Embracing Python</h3>
        <p>
            The introduction to Python during my coursework was a turning point, leading me to explore powerful libraries such as Pandas 
            for data manipulation. This has broadened my perspective on programming and deepened my interest in learning new technologies.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Development</h3>
        <p>
            The development of a comprehensive math website for students showcased my ability to integrate diverse functionalities such as 
            equation solving and resource management. This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also reinforced my capability 
            to manage and implement complex software solutions.
