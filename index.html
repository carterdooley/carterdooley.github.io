        <p>
                Of all the languages I have learned so far, Python has been the most enjoyable. In our course
            we began with javascript, which was enjoyable, but python has much better flow and syntax.
            On my first python project we were instructed to create basic functions and loops to loop through
            a ***** file. However, I had to take it a step further and begun exploring python packages. The first
            one I had come across is a package called "pandas". This package is used to manipulating data from files
            such as CVS or SQL. Once I had the package installed and basic setup in my python file I began to create 
            the loop functions as instructed and it all seemed to click in my mind at once.
