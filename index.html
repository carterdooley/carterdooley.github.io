        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
                At the beggining of this year I was a student at University of Louisiana
            at Lafayette for mechanical engineering. During the summer I decided to change
            my major to computer science and began searching for external sources of Learning
            outside of college. During the Fall I found the DevMountain/HackBright coding
            camp and couldn't resist. Since I've started I have learned more than I could
            imagine and cannot wait to further my studies!

        <h1>Personal Experiences</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Learning New Language</h2>
        <p>
                Of all the languages I have learned so far, Python has been the most enjoyable. In our course
            we began with javascript, which was enjoyable, but python has much better flow and syntax.
            On my first python project we were instructed to create basic functions and loops to loop through
            a CVS file. However, I had to take it a step further and begun exploring python packages. The first
            one I had come across is a package called "pandas". This package is used to manipulating data from files
            such as CVS or SQL. Once I had the package installed and basic setup in my python file I began to create 
            the loop functions as instructed and it all seemed to click in my mind at once. Learning Python has me excited to
            learn new programming languages.

        <h2>Project Build</h2>
        <p>
                Starting a build for a project can seem intimidating, but for
            me, I just get excited. The latest project I worked on was a math website
            for students who spend alot of time on the subject. The project started off
            as a simple calculator page with basic functionality, but then my head got rolling 
            on ideas. Next I added an equations page which hosts two equations as of now and more 
            to come. Writing the equations and calculator was enjoyable for me because I fund
            functionality programming on the front end to be light weight and straight foward.
            My last page I added was the home page. The home page consists of two SQL tables
            for inserting useful resources and songs. Additionaly, the songs table has 
            a shuffle button which will randomly choose a song and play it. I stretched myself 
            thin on time by adding so much functionality and was limited on time I had 
            to style. However, creating this website was a great beggining for programming
            and can't wait to work on future projects.
